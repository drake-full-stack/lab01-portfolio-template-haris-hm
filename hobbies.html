        <h3>3D Modeling & 3D Printing</h3>
        <p>
          I love to do 3D modeling and 3D printing occassionally. Below is a
          piece that I modeled, printed, and painted to give to a friend as a
          gift.

        <h3>Tinkering Around with my Homelab</h3>
        <p>
          Recently, I've started a small homelab which I have been tinkering
          around with, hosting some of my projects on it and just learning about
          server management.
