## 📝 Reflection

After completing this lab, write a few sentences about:

- What was the most challenging part?
- What did you learn about semantic HTML?
- How do you plan to expand this portfolio?

The most challenging part about this lab was figuring out how to do the layouts for the pages in plain HTML. For example, on the portfolio page, I wanted the headshot and intro paragraph side-by-side, so I put them in a table.

_This portfolio will grow throughout the semester as you add React components and full-stack projects!_
