## üìù Reflection

After completing this lab, write a few sentences about:

- What was the most challenging part?
- What did you learn about semantic HTML?
- How do you plan to expand this portfolio?

The most challenging part about this lab was figuring out how to do the layouts for the pages in plain HTML. For example, on the portfolio page, I wanted the headshot and intro paragraph side-by-side, so I put them in a table. As for semantic HTMl, this lab was the first time I actively thought about nesting the tags in a very human-readable way. Prior to this, I had never really used tags like `<section>` or separated content into a `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`. After doing it for this lab, I realize the importance of doing it, as it can make HTML files a lot more human-readable, as well as also help accessibility tools like screen readers. In the future, I plan to expand this portfolio by adding more styling and functionality to the pages through CSS and Javascript. Right now, the pages look very boring, so it's going to be nice to spice things up and add a splash of color and proper layouts.
